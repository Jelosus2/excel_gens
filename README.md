# StarRail Excels Generator
### This tool is used to generate the excels for the npm library [enkanetwork.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/enkanetwork.js)

## How to use
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/Jelosus2/excel_gens`.
2. Clone or download the [StarRail Data Repo](https://github.com/Dimbreath/StarRailData) and place the files of the **ExcelOutput** folder into `excel_gens/data/ExcelOutput` and the files in the **TextMap** folder into `excel_gens/data/TextMap`.
4. Run the `lazy-run.bat` file.
5. Check the `excels_gen/dump` and enjoy :)

Made by me for my library, modify the code to your needs.
